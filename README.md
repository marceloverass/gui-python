# GUI with Python, MySQL and Tkinter

## EN - :uk:

GUI (Graphical User Interface) created for a college project, with the aim of helping a self-employed professional. I created a system to manage dentures, my father is a prosthetist and I hope this simple system can help him in the future.

## Requirements
 * [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

   0. Make sure you have all the requirements above, if not, install/get them.

The following commands should be executed in a CMD, Bash or Powershell window. To do this, go to a folder on your computer, click in the folder path at the top and type CMD, then press enter.

   1. Clone the repository: For this step you need Git installed, but you can just download the zip file instead by clicking the button at the top of this page ☝️
